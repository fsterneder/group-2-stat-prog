# Handedness

In human biology, handedness is a better, faster, or more precise performance or individual preference for use of a hand, known as the dominant hand; the less capable or less preferred hand is called the non-dominant hand. Men are somewhat more likely to express a strongly dominant left hand than women. It is estimated that between 70 and 95 percent of the world's population is right-handed. 

- L vs R? Who has the better stats? 
- Less left-handed people in the past?
- J: Is the proportion of left handers/ non-right handers in baseball the same as in the general population (70-90%)? 

# Age

Andrea: How old do baseball players get? (maybe grouping them in birthdecades, maybe difference to average people in U.S.)  
Andrea: How old are baseball players when they get into the Hall of Fame/get their first award?  
Andrea: What's the average age of playing for the first time (in each league)?  
Andrea: Development of the average age per league/team  

# Batting 

Andrea: Development of Homeruns, Stolen Base, ... (per game?) within the years.  
Andrea: Which player/team/league had the most Homeruns?  

# Player Origin and Team

Andrea: How many players have played in the same state as where they are from? Are there differences in the AL (Americal League)/NL (National League)? (merging CollegePlaying, SchoolsTable and Players) 

J: What are the most "successful" schools/colleges in terms of awards won by players from these schools. We could also rank/sort schools by the number of Hall-of-Fame inductees they "produced".  

J: States that produced the most baseball players, controlled for population size? 

# Teams

Andrea: Which teams win? Where do they come from? Regional differences?  
Andrea: Development of best teams over time?  

# Salaries

J: If possible, we could compute the difference between the average income of the general population of the US and the average income of the baseball players in our data set for each year and plot this difference as a function of time. Did this difference remain steady or increase over time?

# All-Star Game(s)

Andrea: We could analyze the All-Star Game Players and build a model to compute the ones for 2019 (as statistics for the new players are not out yet, we could compute the ones for 2018 (with data until 2017) and then compare it to the real data.
